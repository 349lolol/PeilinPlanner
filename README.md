# PeilinPlanner
PeilinPlanner is a collaborative UML Diagram software that combines Java with JS, HTML, and CSS to allow users to create UML Diagrams in a web browser. Users can view, edit, and download these diagrams from a shared workspace, and upload pre-existing diagrams to PeilinPlanner. Users create accounts and can share projects and diagrams. 

The server stores information in a JSON format with Jackson, meaning information is stored even if the WebSocket server is shut down. Although this was one of our first (very messy) projects, We're still proud of what we accomplished while having to study for 4 grade 12 exams.

This was our 12 AP CS final project :)
